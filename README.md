# README: Using Tableau for Superstore and Netflix Analysis with Dashboards

## Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Tableau for performing analysis on Superstore and Netflix datasets and creating interactive dashboards to visualize the insights. Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that allows you to connect, analyze, and visualize data seamlessly.

## Requirements

- Tableau Desktop installed on your computer.
- Superstore dataset (typically provided with Tableau as a sample dataset).
- Netflix dataset (can be downloaded from various sources, such as Kaggle).
- Basic understanding of data analysis and visualization concepts.

## Getting Started with Tableau

1. **Open Tableau Desktop**: Launch the Tableau Desktop application on your computer.

2. **Connect to Data**:
    - For the Superstore dataset, connect using the provided sample data within Tableau.
    - For the Netflix dataset, connect by navigating to the file location and uploading the dataset (usually in CSV format).

## Superstore Analysis

### Step 1: Connect to Superstore Dataset

1. **Load the Superstore Data**:
    - Click on `Sample - Superstore` under `Saved Data Sources`.
    - This will load the dataset into Tableau, ready for analysis.

### Step 2: Create Key Visualizations

1. **Sales Analysis by Category**:
    - Drag `Category` to the Columns shelf.
    - Drag `Sales` to the Rows shelf.
    - This will create a bar chart showing sales by category.

2. **Profit Analysis by Region**:
    - Drag `Region` to the Columns shelf.
    - Drag `Profit` to the Rows shelf.
    - This will create a bar chart showing profit by region.
    - Color the bars by dragging `Profit` to the Color mark.

3. **Sales Trend Over Time**:
    - Drag `Order Date` to the Columns shelf.
    - Drag `Sales` to the Rows shelf.
    - This will create a line chart showing sales over time.

### Step 3: Create a Dashboard for Superstore

1. **Create a New Dashboard**:
    - Click on the `New Dashboard` icon at the bottom of the Tableau workspace.
    - Drag your created sheets (Sales by Category, Profit by Region, Sales Trend) into the dashboard workspace.
    - Arrange and resize the visualizations as needed.
    - Add filters and interactive elements to enhance the dashboard's usability.

## Netflix Analysis

### Step 1: Connect to Netflix Dataset

1. **Load the Netflix Data**:
    - Navigate to `Connect` pane on the left.
    - Select `Text File` and upload the Netflix dataset (CSV file).

### Step 2: Create Key Visualizations

1. **Content Count by Type**:
    - Drag `Type` (e.g., Movie, TV Show) to the Columns shelf.
    - Drag `Title` to the Rows shelf and change the aggregation to `Count`.
    - This will create a bar chart showing the number of movies and TV shows.

2. **Release Year Distribution**:
    - Drag `Release Year` to the Columns shelf.
    - Drag `Title` to the Rows shelf and change the aggregation to `Count`.
    - This will create a histogram showing the distribution of content release years.

## Publishing and Sharing Dashboards

1. **Save Your Work**:
    - Save your Tableau workbook regularly to avoid losing any work.
    - Go to `File` > `Save As` and choose the desired location on your computer.

2. **Publish to Tableau Public or Tableau Server**:
    - To share your dashboards, you can publish them to Tableau Public (free) or Tableau Server (enterprise).
    - Go to `Server` > `Tableau Public` > `Save to Tableau Public Asâ€¦` or `Server` > `Publish Workbook`.

3. **Embed or Share Links**:
    - Once published, you can embed the dashboards in web pages or share direct links with others.
    - Tableau Public provides options for embedding and sharing.
